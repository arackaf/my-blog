description: A high-level introduction to SvelteKit
---

SvelteKit is the latest of what I'd call next-gen application frameworks. It of course scaffolds an application for you, with the file-based routing, deployment, server-side rendering Next has done forever. But SvelteKit also supports nested layouts, server mutations that sync up the data on your page and some other nicities we'll get into.

This post is just a high-level introduction, to hopefully build some excitement for anyone who's never used it before. Future posts will take some targetted deep dives, but for now we'll just take a relaxed tour. If you like what you see, the full docs are [here](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/introduction).
