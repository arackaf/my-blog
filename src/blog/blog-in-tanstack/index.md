description: Part 1 of a two-part post on building a blog with TanStack Start
---

TanStack start is one of the most exciting new frameworks in web dev. I wrote an introduction to it [here](https://frontendmasters.com/blog/introducing-tanstack-start/) as well as a post dedicated to its middleware feature [here](https://frontendmasters.com/blog/introducing-tanstack-start/).

This post will be a cross-cutting, whirlwind tour of TanStack Stack. In this two-part post we'll build a blog.

Part one will build the blog itself. We'll scan through our markdown files to discover the blog posts dynamically, add syntax highlighting, routing, etc.

In part two we'll leverage TanStack features to get our blog deployed in the most performant way possible.

## Concluding thoughts

Our blog is set up and working. But it's got some performance problems. And if there's one thing a blog shouldn't have, it's performance problems. All the content is static, after all.

Stay tuned for part 2 where we'll dig in, and fix.

Happy Coding!
