description: An introduction to TanStack Router
---

TanStack router is an incredibly exciting project. It's essentially a fully-featured _client-side_ JavaScript application framework. It provides a mature routing and navigation features, with nested layouts, and efficient data loading capabilities at every point in the routing tree. Oh and best of all, it does all of this in a _type-safe_ manner.

What's especially exciting is that as of this writing, there's a TanStack Start in the works, which will add on to Router, to enable you to build full-stack web applications. Start promises to do this with a server layer applied directly on top of the TanStack Router this post will be talking about. That makes this a perfect time to get to know Router if you're not already, which is why we're here.

Router is much more than just a ... router; as we mentioned, it's a fully-fledge client-side application framework. So to prevent this post from getting too long, we won't even try to cover it all. For this post we'll limit ourselves to routing and navigation, which is a larger topic than you might think, especially considered the type-safe nature of Router.

Let's get started!

## Getting started

The TanStack Router docs [are here](https://tanstack.com/router/latest/docs/framework/react/overview). To be frank, the getting started guide is a bit manual, for now. Start promises to add the same kind of nice scaffolding projects like SvelteKit and Next already have, but for now you can just clone [the repo](https://github.com/arackaf/tanstack-router-routing-demo) I used for this project if you'd like to poke around with what we're talking about here.

## Wrapping up

TanStack router is an incredibly exciting project. It's a superbly-made, flexible client-side router that promises fantastic server-side integration in the near future.

Happy Coding!
