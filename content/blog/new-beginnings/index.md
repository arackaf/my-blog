Hi everyone ðŸ‘‹

Until now I've been blogging on Medium, but like others I've become fed up with how rotten that platform has become. Given how superb and polished Gatsby is, and how simple Heroku makes hosting, I figured the time was right to just set up my own blog, and own my own content.

Expect this blog to be a work in progress for some time. I'll spruce it up and make it my own as time permits, but in the meantime there's no shortage of content I'm eager to write. React Hooks are incredibly exciting, and I have some posts that have been in the back of my mind for awhile.

Stay tuned!
