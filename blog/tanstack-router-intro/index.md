description: An introduction to TanStack Router
---

TanStack router is an incredibly exciting project. It's essentially a fully-featured _client-side_ JavaScript application framework. It provides a mature routing and navigation features, with nested layouts, and efficient data loading capabilities at every point in the routing tree. Oh and best of all, it does all of this in a _type-safe_ manner.

What's especially exciting is that as of this writing, there's a TanStack Start in the works, which will add on to Router, to enable you to build full-stack web applications. Start promises to do this with a server layer applied directly on top of the TanStack Router that already exists, which makes this a perfect time to get to know Router.

To prevent this post from being too long, we'll limit ourselves to routing and navigation. Our next post will look at data loading and loaders, and sometime in the (near) future when TanStack Start exists we can look at how that new tool adds full-stack power to these same building blocks.

Let's get started!

## Getting started

The TanStack Router docs [are here](https://tanstack.com/router/latest/docs/framework/react/overview). To be frank, the getting started guide is a bit manual, for now. Start promises to add the same kind of nice scaffolding projects like SvelteKit and Next already have, but for now you can just clone [the repo](https://github.com/arackaf/tanstack-router-routing-demo) I used for this project if you'd like to poke around.

## Wrapping up

TanStack router is an incredibly exciting project. It's a superbly-made, flexible client-side router that promises fantastic server-side integration in the near future.

Happy Coding!
