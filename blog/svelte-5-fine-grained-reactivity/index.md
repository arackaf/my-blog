description: A deep dive into Svelte 5's new fine-grained reactivity
---

This is the third and final post in a three-part series on Svelte 5. In [the first](https://frontendmasters.com/blog/introducing-svelte-5/), we looked at basic features like state, props and side effects. In [the second](https://todo.com) we looked at Snippets, which is a lightweight feature Svelte added for re-using bits of html within (for now) a single component.

In this post, we'll take a close look at Svelte's new fine-grained reactivity.

## What is fine-grained reactivity?

The best way to describe fine-grained reactivity is to show what it isn't, and the best example of non-fine grained reactivity is React. In React, if you're in a single component, no matter how big or how small, setting a single piece of state will cause the entire component, and all of the components (unless they're created with React.memo) that are rendered by the component, the component's children, etc, to also re-render. Even if the state you're setting is rendered in a single, simple span tag in the component, and not used anywhere else at all, the entire world from that component, all the way down will be re-rendered.

This may seem absurdly wasteful, but in actuality this is a consequence of many of the features that made React popular when it was new: the data, values, callbacks, etc that we pass through our component trees are pure, vanilla constructs. We pass plain, vanilla JavaScript objects, arrays and functions around our components and everything just works. At the time, this made an incredibly compelling case for React, vs alternatives like Angular 1 and Knockout. But in that time alternatives like Svelte have really closed the gap. My [first post](https://frontendmasters.com/blog/introducing-svelte-5/) on Svelte 5 showed just how simple, flexible, and most importantly reliable Svlete's new state mangaement primitives are. This post will show you the performance wins these primitives buy us.

## Premature optimization is still bad

This post will walk through some Svelte templates using some trickery to snoop on just how much of a component is being re-rendered when we change state. This is **not** something you will usually, or really ever be doing. As always, write clear and understandable code, and optimize when needed, but not before. The ostensibly inefficient Svelte 4 reactivity we'll look at first is still much, more more performant than what React does out of the box, and React is more than fast enough for the overwhelming majority of use cases.

But being fast enough doesn't mean we can't still look at how much of a better performance baseline Svelte now starts you off at. With a fast-growing ecosystem, and now an incredibly compelling performance story, hopefully this post will encourage you to at least look at Svelte for your next project.

If you'd like to try out the code we'll be looking at in this post, it's all in [this repo](https://github.com/arackaf/svelte-fine-grained-reactivity).

## Getting started

The code we'll be looking at is all from a SvelteKit scaffolded project. If you've never used Svelte _Kit_ before that's totally fine. You can check it out [here](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/creating-a-project), but we're not really using any SvelteKit features until the very, very end of this post, and even then it's just re-hashing what we've already covered.

Throughout this post we're going to be inspecting if and when individual bindings in a component are re-evaluated when we change state. There's various ways to do this, but the simplest and frankly dumbest is to just force some global, non-reactive, always-changing state into these bindings. What do I mean by that? In the very, very root page that hosts our web app, I'm adding this little helper

```html
<script>
  var __i = 0;
  var getCounter = () => __i++;
</script>
```

This adds a completely global `getCounter` function, as well as the `__i` variable. `getCounter` will always return the next value, and if we stick a call to it in our bindings, we'll be able to snoop on when those bindings are being re-executed by Svelte. If you're using TypeScript, you can avoid errors when calling this like so

```ts
declare global {
  interface Window {
    getCounter(): number;
  }
}

export {};
```

This post will look at different pages binding to the same data, declared mostly like this (we'll note differences as we go).

```ts
let tasks = [
  { id: 1, title: "Task A", assigned: "Adam", importance: "Low" },
  { id: 2, title: "Task B", assigned: "Adam", importance: "Medium" },
  { id: 3, title: "Task C", assigned: "Adam", importance: "High" },
  { id: 4, title: "Task D", assigned: "Mike", importance: "Medium" },
  { id: 5, title: "Task E", assigned: "Adam", importance: "High" },
  { id: 6, title: "Task F", assigned: "Adam", importance: "High" },
  { id: 7, title: "Task G", assigned: "Steve", importance: "Low" },
  { id: 8, title: "Task H", assigned: "Adam", importance: "High" },
  { id: 9, title: "Task I", assigned: "Adam", importance: "Low" },
  { id: 10, title: "Task J", assigned: "Mark", importance: "High" },
  { id: 11, title: "Task K", assigned: "Adam", importance: "Medium" },
  { id: 12, title: "Task L", assigned: "Adam", importance: "High" },
];
```

And we'll render these tasks with this markup

```html
<div class="flex flex-col gap-3">
	{#each tasks as t}
		<div class="flex flex-row items-center gap-9">
			<div class="flex flex-row items-center gap-2">
				<span>{t.id + getCounter()}</span>
				<button onclick={() => (t.id += 10)} class="border p-2">Update id</button>
			</div>
			<div class="flex flex-row items-center gap-2">
				<span>{t.title + getCounter()}</span>
				<button onclick={() => (t.title += 'X')} class="border p-2">Update title</button>
			</div>
			<div class="flex flex-row items-center gap-2">
				<span>{t.assigned + getCounter()}</span>
				<button onclick={() => (t.assigned += 'X')} class="border p-2">Update assigned</button>
			</div>
			<div class="flex flex-row items-center gap-2">
				<span>{t.importance + getCounter()}</span>
				<button onclick={() => (t.importance += 'X')} class="border p-2">Update importance</button>
			</div>
		</div>
	{/each}
</div>
```

The Svelte 4 code we'll start with will use the `on:click` synatx for events, but everything else will be the same.

The calls to `getCounter` right inside the bindings will let us see when those bindings are re-executed, since the call to `getCounter()` will always return a new value.

Let's get started

## Svelte 4

Ok let's get started. We'll render the content we saw above, using Svelte 4.

![Svelte 4](/svelte-5-fine-grained-reactivity/svelte4.png)

Plain and simple. But now let's click any of those buttons, to modify one property, of one of those tasksâ€”it doesn't matter which.

![Svelte 4 after an update](/svelte-5-fine-grained-reactivity/svelte4-updated.png)

Notice that the entire component (every binding in the component) re-rendered. As inefficient as this seems, it's _still_ much better than what React does. It's not remotely uncommon for a single state update to trigger _multiple_ re-renders of _many_ components.

Let's see how Svelte 5 improves things.

## Svelte 5

For Svelte 5, the code is pretty much the same, except we declare out state like this

```ts
let tasks = $state([
  { id: 1, title: "Task A", assigned: "Adam", importance: "Low" },
  // and so on ...
  { id: 12, title: "Task L", assigned: "Adam", importance: "High" },
]);
```

and all those `on:click` event handlers are now `onclick`.

We render the page, and see the same as before. If you're following along in the repo, be sure to refresh the page after navigating, so the page will start over with the global counter.

![Svelte 5](/svelte-5-fine-grained-reactivity/svelte5.png)

Now let's change one piece of state, as before. We'll update the title for Task C, the third one.

![Svelte 5](/svelte-5-fine-grained-reactivity/svelte5-updated.png)

and just like that, only the single piece of state we modified has re-rendered. Svelte was smart enough to leave everything else alone. 99% of the time this won't make any difference, but if you're rendering a _lot_ of data on a page, this can be a substantial performance win.

### Why did this happen

This is actually the default behavior when we pass arrays and objects (and arrays of objects) into the `$state` rune, like we did with `let tasks = $state([`. Svelte will read everything you pass, set up [Proxy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Proxy) objects to track what changes, and update the absolute minimum amount of dom nodes necessary.

## False Coda

We could easily end the post here. Use the `$state` primitive to track your reactive data. Svelte will make it deeply reactive, and update whatever it needs to update when you change anything. This will be _just fine_ the vast majority of the time.

But what if you're writing a web application that has to manage a _ton_ of data. Having everything be deeply reactive is not without cost.

Let's see how we can tell Svelte that only _some of_ our data are reactive. I'll stress again, laboring over this will almost never be needed. But it's good to know how it works if it ever comes up.

## Rediscovering a long-lost JavaScript feature

Classes in JavaScript have gotten an unfortunately bad reputation. Classes are an outstanding way to declare the _structure_ of a set of objects, along with a built-in factory function. Not only that, but TypeScript is deeply integrated with them.

You can declare

```ts
class Person {
  firstName: string;
  lastName: string;

  constructor(firstName: string, lastName: string) {
    this.firstName = firstName;
    this.lastName = lastName;
  }
}
```

Not only does this provide you a factory function for creating instance of a Person, via `new Person('Adam', 'Rackis')`, but `Person` can also be used as a type within TypeScript. You can create variables or function parameters of type `Person`. It's one of the few things that exist as a runtime construct, and also a TypeScript type.

So why am I bringing up classes in this post?

## Fine-grained reactivity in Svelte 5

If you have a performance-sensitive section of code where you need to mark some properties as non-reactive, you can do this by creating class instances, rather than vanilla JavaScript objects. Let's define a Task class for our tasks. For the properties we _want to_ be reactive, we'll set default values with the `$state()` rune. For properties we _don't_ want to be reactive, we won't.

```ts
class Task {
  id: number = 0;
  title = $state("");
  assigned = $state("");
  importance = $state("");

  constructor(data: Task) {
    Object.assign(this, data);
  }
}
```

And then we just use that class

```ts
let tasks = $state([
  new Task({ id: 1, title: "Task A", assigned: "Adam", importance: "Low" }),
  // and so on
  new Task({ id: 12, title: "Task L", assigned: "Adam", importance: "High" }),
]);
```

I simplified the class a bit by just taking a raw object with all the properties of the class, and assigning them all with `Object.assign`. The object literal is typed in the constructor as `Task`, the same as the class, but that's fine because of TypeScript's [structural typing](https://css-tricks.com/typescript-discriminated-unions/).

## Wrapping up

One of the most exciting features of Svelte 5 is the fine-grained reactivity it adds. Svelte was already lightweight, and faster than most, if not all of the alternatives. These additions in version 5 only improve on that.

Happy Coding!
