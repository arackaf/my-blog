Position sticky is one of those features that's incredibly useful, _seemingly_ simple, and also, frequently, very frustrating.

The premise is simple; you want to be able to scroll your page's content, as always, but you want something to "stick" at the top (or anywhere). Frequetly this will be some sort of header content that you want to always stay at the top, even as the user scrolls, but again it can be anything.

We'll cover a brief introduction to sticky positioning. We'll see how it works, and then we'll look at some common, frustrating ways it can fail, and we'll learn _exactly_ how to fix it.

For all the code examples I'll be using React, along with Tailwind. I know the Tailwind piece might be controversial to some. But really, for this post, it'll allow me to show everything in one place, without ever requiring you, dear reader, to toggle between html markup, and a css file.

## Using position sticky

## Concluding thoughts

I hope this post has taught you some new things about position sticky which come in handy someday.

Happy Coding!
