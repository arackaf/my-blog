## Introduction

This post is part 1 of a 2-part series on database indexes. Part 1 is a practical, hands-on, applicable approach to indexes. We'll cover what B+ trees are, of course, but with a focus on deeply understanding, and internalizing how they store data on disk, and how your database uses them to speed up queries.

This will set us up nicely for part 2, where we'll explore some interesting, counterintuitive ways to press indexes into service to achieve great querying performance over large amounts of data.

Everything in these posts will use Postgres, but absolutely everything is directly applicable to other relational databases. All the queries I'll be running are against a simple books database which I scaffolded, and had Cursor populate with about 90 million records. DDL for the database, as well as the code to fill it are in [this repo](https://github.com/arackaf/postgres-indexing-post) if you'd like to follow along on your own: `sql/db_create.sql` has the DDL, and `npx tsx insert-data/fill-database.ts` will run the code to fill it.

## Setting some baselines

Just for fun, let's take a look at the first 10 rows in the books table. Don't look too close, again, this was all algorithmically generated by AI. The special characters at the beginning were my crude way forcing the (extremely repetative) titles to spread out.

That's the last time we'll be looking at actual data. From here forward, we'll look at queries, the execution plans they generate, then we'll talk about how indexes might, or might not be able to help.

Let's get started. Let's see what the prior query looks like by putting `explain analyze` before it. This tells Postgres to execute the query, and return to use the execution plan it used, as well as its performance.

```sql
explain analyze
select * from books limit 10;
```
